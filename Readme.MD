# Overview

I started this project to help better understand game frameworks, and explore some of the options within creating games through using different python libraries. I wanted to better understand how to create visuals and interactive Games to give me better insight on the creation process. 

I created a simple two player pong game. This game Generates two half's of a Window with a left and a right player. The left player controls his paddle up and down with the W and the S keys, While the right player controls the paddle with the up and down arrows. I also added a random color change to the paddles so whenever They hit the ball they change to a different color so you know you made a hit.

I wrote this software to be a learning opportunity, as well as a fun interactive program I can share with my family. Through this software, I am able to practice fundamentals of programming, while expanding my knowledge into graphics and programming logic.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used VS code to wright and run my software. I used a mixture of school programming notes to review basic programming fundamentals, such as he structure of classes and, chat rooms, YouTube tutorials, and the pygame website.

This project was created using Python and the pygame library.

# Future Work

* I need to put detailed instructions on both sides of the players screens.
* I want to add levels that will increase the number of balls to be hit.
* I want to turn this into an arcade where at the beginning there's an option to pick from a variety of games.
